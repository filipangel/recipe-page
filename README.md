# Frontend Mentor - Recipe page solution

This is a solution to the [Recipe page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/recipe-page-KiTsR8QQKm). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This one was fairly difficult because the image on the top 'unsticks' from the edges of the browser to become part of the container on larger screen sizes. Frontend Mentor challenges are made with only two sizes in mind (375px and 1440px) so making the designs look relatively okay while manually resizing the browser between these two widths is mostly guesswork. I'm happy with the results, especially considering the first time I did this challenge I only made the desktop design which meant it was near impossible to transform it into the mobile version.
